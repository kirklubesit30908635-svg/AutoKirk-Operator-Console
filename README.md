# Autokirk Web (Static)

This is a **static** (no-framework) landing page repo designed to deploy cleanly to **Netlify**.

## Deploy to Netlify
- Build command: *(none)*
- Publish directory: `.` (repo root)

Netlify will serve `index.html` directly.

## Lead capture
The form in the "Request early access" section uses **Netlify Forms**:
- It works automatically once deployed.
- Submissions will appear in your Netlify site dashboard under **Forms**.

## Files
- `index.html` – single-page site
- `styles.css` – styling
- `script.js` – tiny UI helper (toast + year)
- `netlify.toml` – optional defaults for Netlify
- `assets/` – noise + favicon
