# AutoKirk Systems — Soft Lock v0.9 (Implementation Grade)

**Effective:** Immediately  
**Purpose:** Prevent ontology drift before Core Constitution v1.

## Core Rules
1) **Primitive Freeze:** Only the six core primitives exist. No new primitives without amendment.  
2) **API/RPC-Only Writes:** No direct table writes from UI. All mutation flows through governed RPC.  
3) **Append-Only Audit:** Ledger + closure history is immutable. Mutation is supersession, not edits.  
4) **MEL First:** No feature expansion until Minimum Enforceable Loop proves closures in production.  
5) **No Dashboard Drift:** No analytics-only screens. Evidence is allowed only if it drives enforcement.  
6) **Manual-First Sequencing:** Integrations come after closure proof, not before.  
7) **Role-Scoped Operator Authority:** Operator-only closure is preserved; authority may be delegated by role.

## Freeze Trigger for Core Constitution v1
- Face #003 runs live and closes real obligations.  
- ≥50 closures recorded.  
- ≥1 escalation handled.  
- 30+ days without core primitive changes.

After that: Core Constitution v1 locks the kernel.
