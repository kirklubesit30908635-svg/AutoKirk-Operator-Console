# AutoKirk Systems — Core Primitives (SOFT LOCK v0.9)

**Status:** Soft Locked (v0.9)  
**Rule:** No new core primitives without amendment.

## Frozen Core Primitives
1. Promise
2. Obligation
3. Closure
4. Ledger Event
5. Economic Outcome
6. Operator

## Non-Negotiables
- Append-only audit history (no silent edits)
- Deterministic lifecycle transitions
- Idempotent write paths with request_id
- Operator-only closure authority (role-scoped allowed)
- UI is not authority; UI is read + action initiator only

> If it isn’t written here, it didn’t happen.  
> Same Core. Different Workspaces. No drift.
