# AutoKirk Systems — Operator Law Pack (Face #003)

## What This System Is
AutoKirk is an enforcement system. It exists to ensure promises close.

## Definitions
- **Promise:** A revenue-linked commitment that must resolve.
- **Obligation:** A required next action spawned from a Promise.
- **Closure:** The only lawful completion.
- **Ledger:** The record. If it isn’t written here, it didn’t happen.

## Daily Use
1) Open **Next Actions**
2) Close the oldest overdue items first
3) Record closure outcome cleanly (no vague language)
4) If blocked, record the block reason and escalate

## Authority
Only Operators can close promises/obligations.  
Sales staff execute obligations; Operators close.

## Weekly Ritual (Non-Negotiable)
Once per week:
- Review open promises
- Review overdue obligations
- Confirm closures were recorded
- Confirm no work is “handled” unless it’s written
